// Q. You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the position of a stall. You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. Your task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

// Examples :

// Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0], 
// the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and 
// the third cow can be placed at stalls[3]. 
// The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the largest among all possible ways.
